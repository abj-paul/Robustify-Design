*** Draft. Understanding Backend
Hmm it seems we have a lotta endpoint in backend to save everything. Lets test them. Lets start with authentication testing. If test works, lets integrate it with frontend. Lets build a simple dashboard in frontend.

Now let us connect the dashboard. Develop system specification upload first. If you can do it, you can do the rest of the three as well.


Today, I will do the following tasks.
1. [X] Set project-name in cache (9:10)
2. [X] Submit specification (save as sql and file) (10:00)
3. [ ] Place the specification code in 4 parts (11:30)
4. [X] Save as sql and file (12:00)
5. [ ] Multi file specification
6. [ ] Execute fortis (1:00)
7. [ ] Show reports 
8. [ ] Create Project
9. [ ] Report in window
10. [ ] LLM Insights on report window

*** Dockerizing
--> Two fastapi backend
--> Data folder to retain image in fastapi

*** Techs
- cache-busting
