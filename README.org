* About
We are trying to convert state transition diagram to LTS format.
** UML To Alloy
I find no tool available for it like [[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12261-3_16][UML to Alloy and back again]] but I can't find their implementation anywhere. So I will make it myself.

We only consider UML diagrams with OCL constraints.

** STD to LTS
We think that state transition diagrams are also automata so we should be able to easily convert state transition diagrams to LTS notation.

[[file:misc/voting-std.png]]

For the above STD, we have the following sys.lts
#+begin_src LTS
EM = (password -> P1),
P1 = (select -> P2),
P2 = (vote -> P3 | back -> P1),
P3 = (confirm -> EM | back -> P2).
#+end_src


We have a bunch of examples of LTS specification from [[https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/ltsa/samples/][Concurrency: State Models & Java Programs Book]]. And we are using [[https://github.com/yylonly/LTSA][LTS tool]] to evaluate whether are conversion is fine or not.
