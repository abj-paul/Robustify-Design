* About
EnvGuard is a tool that presents a modern interface to robustify behavioral designs against environmental deviations. It includes a ~uml-to-ltl~ parser so agile developers can easily robustify their UML designs. Additionally, it integrates the power of ~Gemini~ to make exploration of design alternatives more intuitive.
