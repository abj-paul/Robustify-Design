EnvGuard is a tool that presents a modern interface to robustify behavioral designs against environmental deviations. It includes a ~uml-to-ltl~ parser so agile developers can easily robustify their UML designs. Additionally, it integrates the power of ~Gemini~ to make exploration of design alternatives more intuitive.

** Installation & Update
We recommend using the docker for compatibility with all OS and cloud infrastructures. First, install docker following the instructions in docs.docker.com.
#+begin_src sh
  # Add Docker's official GPG key:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
  sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
  sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
  sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

  # Add the repository to Apt sources:
  echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
#+end_src
After installing docker, download the EnvGuard orchestration script and simply start the docker. Note that, you should replace ~0.0.0.0~ with your cloud host server or remote server, as appropriate.
#+begin_src sh
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abj-paul/Robustify-Design/refs/heads/main/installation/docker-compose.yml 
  HOST_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 sudo -E docker compose up
#+end_src

If you prefer a shell based installation script for ubuntu and windows, checkout ~installation/~ folder for beta version of installation scripts. Additionally, check ~docs/User-Manual.org~ to get started on how to use this tool.
