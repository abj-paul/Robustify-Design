We are trying to convert state transition diagram to FSP format. Our end goal is to enable robustification of UML designs using Fortis tool.

We need to convert UML to LTL. A parser would be hard. So we had this inspiration - as we saw in LTSA tool, every safety property can be expressed as a state transition diagram. Professor also confirmed that. So instead of complex parsing, I would instead bring the complexity to defining the requirements using UML diagrams. This way, we can easily use our system.

** Backend
- [ ] Take LTL as input
- [ ] Show output
- [ ] Take UML as input
