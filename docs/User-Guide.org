EnvGuard is a robust solution designed to protect systems from environmental deviations. It provides an intuitive interface that allows users to upload, modify, understand, robustify, and explore various design alternatives. The platform also integrates with Gemini, enabling users to communicate with the system and get more detailed explanations about the generated designs. This guide will walk you through all the essential features and functionalities of EnvGuard.

** Project Management Overview
The Project Management feature in EnvGuard is designed to simplify the organization of your design projects. It offers a centralized location where users can manage their projects and associated specifications. Users can create new projects, access existing ones, and track the status of their work with ease. The project management section ensures that you stay organized and efficient as you work through multiple design iterations.

*** Project List
In this section, you can view all the existing projects stored within EnvGuard. Each project is listed with its name and associated details, allowing you to easily select and open them. If you want to create a new project, there is an option to do so right here. Once a project is selected, you are directed to the project’s detailed management page.

By clicking on any project, you will open its specific page, where you can view and manage the project's content.

*** Project Hub
The Project Hub serves as a central location for managing all aspects of a project. It provides a one-stop dashboard where users can manage the project’s requirements, robustification settings, and design exploration features. Here, you can upload your UML and LTL specifications, configure system parameters, and visualize how the system’s behavior is represented. The Project Hub simplifies the process of coordinating and managing your work.

You can easily upload and edit UML and LTL specifications here, providing the flexibility to define your system's behavior precisely.

** System Configuration and Robustification
The configuration and robustification sections are essential for ensuring that your design can withstand environmental deviations. Through these features, you can upload system specifications, define safety properties using LTL notation, and customize the robustification process using JSON format. This allows users to adapt and configure the system to meet their specific requirements and safety standards.

*** System Specifications and Safety Properties
In this section, users can upload system specifications that define the behavior of the system being modeled. For the safety property, LTL notation is commonly used to describe the desired behavior and rules for the system. This step ensures that all potential environmental changes and disruptions are considered when designing the system. System specifications play a vital role in the robustification process.

Users can upload different types of system configurations and refine them as necessary to fit the specific needs of their design.

*** Robustification Process
The robustification process is the core feature that strengthens the behavioral model against environmental deviations. Once you have uploaded your system specifications, you can initiate robustification by clicking the “Robustification” button. This process may take up to a minute, depending on the complexity of the design. During this time, the system analyzes the design and applies the necessary adjustments to ensure robustness. A success message will notify you once the process has completed.

This feature is critical to ensure that the system remains stable and functions correctly in various environmental scenarios.

** Report Generation and Design Alternatives
EnvGuard generates comprehensive reports after the robustification process is completed. These reports not only show the final robustified design but also provide a detailed comparison of alternative design configurations. Each design alternative is assigned a complexity score, helping users evaluate the most efficient and optimal designs. This section ensures that you can analyze and select the best design solution based on your needs.

*** Report Overview
The report section is where you can access and review all the versions of your design. EnvGuard stores all versions of your reports, making it easy to track changes over time and explore different iterations of the design. Clicking on any report will open an HTML page that provides further details about that specific design. This feature helps you keep track of the progress of each design and compare alternatives efficiently.

This section serves as a key tool for communication within the team, allowing easy sharing of designs with colleagues.

*** Exploring Design Alternatives
The design alternatives are presented in a collapsible view to reduce cognitive load while exploring. By expanding each design, you can see additional details and assess the complexity and feasibility of each one. This ranking system allows users to quickly navigate through the designs, from the simplest to the most complex. The interface is designed to make exploring different design configurations as intuitive and efficient as possible.

Users can also download designs using the browser's default print functionality, providing a simple way to store or share designs outside the application.

** Gemini Integration for Enhanced Interaction
Gemini integration in EnvGuard makes exploring design alternatives even more intuitive. Through Gemini, users can select a design and initiate a conversation to better understand the design details or ask specific questions. This feature allows you to interact with the system in a more conversational manner, offering a unique way to engage with the design alternatives. It enables more personalized support and guidance when making decisions about the design.

After selecting a design, previous chats with Gemini will be loaded, providing context for your ongoing discussion.

You can easily text to chat and get responses within 2-5 seconds. This provides an interactive experience, helping you explore design alternatives more deeply.

** Project Management: Creating, Updating, and Deleting Projects
EnvGuard allows users to easily create, modify, and delete projects from the Project Hub. If you need to create a new project, simply click the "Create New Project" button and enter the project name and description. Projects with the same name can coexist, so there are no restrictions on naming. You can also modify the project name and description as needed or delete a project entirely.

Clicking "Edit Project" from the Project Hub will give you access to the modification options. If you decide to delete a project, the system will redirect you back to the Project List layout after successful deletion.

** User Authentication and Registration
EnvGuard ensures secure access to your projects through user authentication and authorization. To log in, simply provide your username and password, and complete the captcha verification to ensure security. Once logged in, you can start managing your projects. If you're new to EnvGuard, you can easily register by providing a unique username, your organization name, and a password that must be at least 6 characters long.
