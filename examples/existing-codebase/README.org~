* About
To evaluate robustification, run the following command.
#+begin_src bash
  java -jar bin/fortis.jar robustness -s examples/therac25/sys.lts -e examples/therac25/env0.lts -p examples/therac25/p.lts -d examples/therac25/env.lts
#+end_src

To robustify,
#+begin_src bash
cd examples/voting
java -jar ../../bin/fortis.jar robustify config-pareto.json
#+end_src

Note: We extend the work from https://github.com/cmu-soda/fortis-core. We could not fork due to some issues.

** UML To Alloy
I find no tool available for it like [[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12261-3_16][UML to Alloy and back again]] but I can't find their implementation anywhere. So I will make it myself.

** STD to LTS
We think that state transition diagrams are also automata so we should be able to easily convert state transition diagrams to LTS notation.

[[file:misc/voting-std.png]]

For the above STD, we have the following sys.lts
#+begin_src LTS
EM = (password -> P1),
P1 = (select -> P2),
P2 = (vote -> P3 | back -> P1),
P3 = (confirm -> EM | back -> P2).
#+end_src
